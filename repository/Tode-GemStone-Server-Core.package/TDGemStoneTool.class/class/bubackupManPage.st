  bu backup - Make a GemStone backup

SYNOPSIS
  bu [--dir=<backup-directory>] backup [--safely] [--commit] [--novalidate] [--uncompressed] \
                                       <backup-file>

DESCRIPTION
  Make a GemStone backup in the specified backup file. By default a compressed 
  backup is created and a `.gz` is tacked onto the end of the <backup-file> if 
  not already present. By default the backup is validated (`bu validate`) after
  backup is completed.

  With no options specified, the backup file will be located in the directory 
  specified by the `bu directory` command. The default backup directory is named
  ''backups'' and is located in the $GEMSTONE_DATADIR.

  With the --dir option specified, the backup file will be stored in the named
  directory.

  With the --safely option specified, the backup will (quietly) be skipped if
  the target backup file already exists.

  With the --uncompressed option an uncompressed backup is created in the named
  <backup-file>.

  With the --novalidate option the default validation is not performed.

  With the --commit option specified a commit is made immediately before checkpoints
  are suspended. The --commit option should be used when running in batch mode (i.e.,
  a bash shell script) or when autoCommit has been disabled to ensure that the current
  state of the gem is included in the snapshot.
